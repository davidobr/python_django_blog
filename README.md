## Python blog made using django

# Aims of this project
I want to use Django to create a basic blog (to start off with) and potentially make it more complex as time goes by. Continuous improvement to this project will be fun.
Some aims:
* I want to create a blog where a user can register, login, logout.
* I want the user to be able to create a blog, read blog posts, update their blog and also delete their blog post if they wish
* I want to learn more about unit tests and create those as well to ensure code stays functional when changes are made to the code
* Continue to improve/practice and get better overtime with git

Some information about getting django up and running:

Running the server locally:
```commandline
python manage.py runserver
```
Then it'll be accessible from the following URL:
```commandline
127.0.0.1:8000
```
If you want to run the unit tests

```commandline
python manage.py test
```

Installing the modules/packages used on this project enter the following:
```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## TODO for this readme
As the project improves, I want to keep updating the readme when possible to give as much information as possible
